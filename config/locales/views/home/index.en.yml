          Hi! I’m Jason.
        </p>
        <p>
          I live in Oregon with my wife, Shandy.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m a writer. Mostly horror. Currently working on my first novel, <i>The Devil's Castle</i>,
          about a haunted reality show, like Big Brother if it were filmed in Hill House.
        </p>
        <p>
          My writing has won first place in the Zebulon contest at the
          <a href="https://pikespeakwriters.com/" target="_blank">Pikes Peak Writers Conference</a>.
          I'm a member of the <a href="https://horror.org/" target="_blank">HWA</a>, and my short
          fiction has appeared in
          <a href="https://pseudopod.org/people/jason-rush/" target="_blank">Pseudopod</a>.
