          Hi! I’m Jason. Here are some things about me:
        </p>
        <p>
          I live in Oregon with my wife, Shandy.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m a writer. Mostly horror. I'm represented by Lynnette Novak at the
          <a href="https://www.theseymouragency.com/" target="_blank">Seymour Agency</a>,
          who is currently subbing my first novel, <i>Where the Dead Seep Through</i>,
          the story of six mountain climbers, trapped in a supernatural storm and haunted by the
          vengeful ghost of a centuries-old priest.
        </p>
        <p>
          A recent transplant from Colorado, I wrote <i>Where the Dead Seep Through</i> while living
          deep in the Rockies, where I spent my free time hiking and snowshoeing in the backcountry.
        </p>
        <p>
          My writing has won first place in the Zebulon contest at the
          <a href="https://pikespeakwriters.com/" target="_blank">Pikes Peak Writers Conference</a>.
          I'm a member of the <a href="https://horror.org/" target="_blank">HWA</a>, and my short
          fiction has appeared in
          <a href="https://pseudopod.org/people/jason-rush/" target="_blank">Pseudopod</a>.
